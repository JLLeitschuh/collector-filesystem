The following are either things to be done, or ideas to consider:
- DateFormatTagger: accept multiple fields (CSV) or a pattern.

- Consider a maxDepth (folder depth).

- Add delay optoin similar to http collector.  Consider making it part
  of Collector Core.

- Remove org.apache.commosn.vfs.provider.[smb|mime] package and replace with 
  appropriate Jar dependency when available in a Maven repo.
