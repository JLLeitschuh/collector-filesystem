$h2 Configuration Quick start

To get started quickly, download the latest version of 
Norconex Filesystem Collector and locate the file 
[./examples/HOWTO_RUN_EXAMPLES.txt](./examples/HOWTO_RUN_EXAMPLES.txt).  
This file will point you to a functional configuration file and will have you 
running a very simple crawler in no time.  These sample files are also made 
available here for your convinience:

  * [Functional Configuration Sample](./examples/sample-config.xml)
  * [Self-Documented Configuration Reference](./examples/collector-filesystem-config-reference.xml)


$h2 Filesystem Collector Configuration Options

To get the full potential of Norconex Filesystem Collector and learn which parts 
can easily be extended, refer to the following for an XML-based configuration.
Entries with a "class" attribute are expecting an implementation
of your choice.   The Filesystem Collector API offers several concrete
implementations already.  Developers can also create their own
by implementing the proper Java interfaces. Refer to the
[Norconex Filesystem Collector JavaDoc](./apidocs/index.html)
and/or see further down what interfaces you can implement.
Go to the
[Extend the Filesystem Collector](./usage.html#Extend_the_Filesystem_Collector)
page for more details on adding your own implementations.

           <!-- All default crawler options are the same you use can use 
                here (overwriting defaults).  You need to define at least one
                crawler. -->
        </crawler>
        ...
      </crawlers>
    
    </fscollector>

The table below lists interface names that you can easily extend, and
also lists available out-of-the-box implementations.
Class names starting with "Default..." are the ones automatically configured
by default unless you overwrite them.

In the configuration file, **you have to use the fully qualified name**,
as defined in the Javadoc (you can use variables to shorten package names).  
Click on a class or interface name to go directly
to its full documentation, with extra configuration options.

$h2 Importer Configuration Options

The [Importer](http://www.norconex.com/product/importer/) module
is an integral part of the Filesystem Collector.  It is reponsible for extracting
text out of documents. It also provides document manipulation options and 
filtering options.  Much more is found in this module distributed with the Filesystem Collector.   
Read the [Importer Configuration Options](http://www.norconex.com/product/importer/configuration.html).

$h2 Committer Configuration Options

The [Committer](http://www.norconex.com/product/committer/) module is 
responsible for taking the text extracted out of 
your collected documents and submit it to your target repository (e.g. 
search engine).  Make sure you download a 
[Committer implementation](http://www.norconex.com/product/committer/#list)
matching your target repository.  Configuration options for is specific
to each committers.  Refer to your committer documentation.


$h2 More Options

There is a lot more you can do to structure your configuration files
the way you like.  Refer to this
[additional documentation](../commons-lang/apidocs/com/norconex/commons/lang/config/ConfigurationLoader.html)
for more configuration options such as creating reusable
configuration fragments and using variables to make your files easier
to maintain and more portable across different environments.
