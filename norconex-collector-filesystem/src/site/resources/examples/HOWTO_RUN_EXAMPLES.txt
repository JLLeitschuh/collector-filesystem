To run the test, go to the root directory where you uncompressed the 
distribution zip and run the following in a command-line console.


Windows:
========

collector-fs.bat -a start -c examples/sample-config.xml


Unix/Linux:
===========

collector-fs.sh -a start -c examples/sample-config.xml


-----------

Look for a directory called "examples-output".  You will
find sub-directories matching the test you ran.  In them, you will find
a directory called "crawledFiles" containing the collected data.
